# bitfinex-api-arena

The purpose of this repo is to run through the bitfinex API and test that everything makes sense to the average reader.

I hope as a dual purpose, people will use the code to learn/use for their own tool that interacts with Bitfinex :)

If you have any issues interacting with the API... PLEASE ping me / open an issue. I would love to help you out!

## Todo:
- v1
- v2
- bitfinex-api-node
- bitfinex-api-rb
- python stuff
- tests
- format in a way that makes the most sense for someone new
- TEST new_deposit via bitfinex-api-node on production, update all docs
- TEST wallet_balances on production!
